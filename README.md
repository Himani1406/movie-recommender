## Introduction
Movie recommendation systems play a crucial role in helping users discover new movies they might enjoy. This project focuses on developing a recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques to suggest personalized movie recommendations. Natural Language Processing - Stemming, CountVectorization are used in this project.

## Dataset
We provide training and test datasets that include user ratings for various movies. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). <!-- Provide a link to the dataset if it's publicly available -->

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repository

## Usage
1. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `your-jupyterNotebook.ipynb`.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, build the recommendation model, and evaluate its performance.

## Notebook
The Jupyter notebook `your-jupyterNotebook.ipynb` provides a step-by-step guide to the entire recommendation system pipeline. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.

## Model
Our recommendation system utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to generate 5 movies that match the user's preference the most. Collaborative filtering takes into account user preferences and suggests movies based on similar user behavior.


## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you are preparing an end-toend project , use this preprocessed dataset to create it or if you have ideas for improvements, additional features, or bug fixes, please create a pull request.
